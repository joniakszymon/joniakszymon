- 👋 Hi, I’m @joniakszymon

- 👀 I’m interested in creating new things. I love wood and vegetation. In free time I like take care of the garden,
     create simple wooden furniture, but now I devote my time to development towards programming (and cooking and growing herbs to breathe and chill).
     At the beginning, when I decided to go towards IT, I was mainly thinking about a safe future and good earnings,
     but while learning about programming and when my code started to work, I realized that I really like it!
     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and I'm going to go to learn Python soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with company that creates interesting projects. I would like to try to do something more interesting than usual websites.
